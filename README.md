a vagrant box for cosmo UI tests, running in ec2  
  
At first you must install [vagrant-aws plugin](https://github.com/mitchellh/vagrant-aws)

Running on EC2
--------------
In order to run this machine on EC2 you will need to do the following:  
```git clone https://github.com/hagaiGS/cosmo-ui-tests-vagrant.git```  
``` cd cosmo-ui-tests-vagrant```  
```vagrant plugin install vagrant-aws```.  
```vagrant up --provider=aws```.  
For further information about vagrant-aws see [https://github.com/mitchellh/vagrant-aws](https://github.com/mitchellh/vagrant-aws) and [http://www.iheavy.com/2014/01/16/how-to-deploy-on-amazon-ec2-with-vagrant/](http://www.iheavy.com/2014/01/16/how-to-deploy-on-amazon-ec2-with-vagrant/)  

To verify that selenium works go to [http://localhost:4444/wd/hub/static/resource/hub.html](http://localhost:4444/wd/hub/static/resource/hub.html)  


Creating EC2-image ("ami")
--------------------------
After following the instructions under [Running on EC2 section](https://github.com/hagaiGS/cosmo-ui-tests-vagrant#running-on-ec2), follow the instructions [here](http://www.cyberciti.biz/tips/linux-how-to-run-a-command-when-boots-up.html) to run the script ```/vagrant/provision.sh``` on startup. Now, simply go to your EC2 console, right-click your instance and click 'create image'.
You have just created an image that boots up with a ready to go selenium server.
Note that you need to configure the security group under which the instance runs in order to allow access to the selenium server
